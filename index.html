                        This project is about transforming giving images of magazines in text and metadata, giving to the user this way information about the autor, 
                        title, and the raw text. 
                        “Automatic magazines filling” suppose to have a program that is capable to recognize in other images or documents the appropriate 
                        data and metadata. In this case we have a data base with images of articles, magazines, newspapers, screenshots which will be given as 
                        training data for our program. A small reprezenattion is in the images on the right.

                        From my point of view this program will save a lot of time for that people who search a specific information and want to see everything 
                        about it. Earlier, when the people didn’t use the computer, it was quite difficult to find an information through the big mountains of 
                        newspapers, magazines etc. Now when we have so many opportunities it is much easier to filter the data, but you need a program to do it for you.
                         And now this is what we are going to do
