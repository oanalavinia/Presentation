                        This project is about transforming giving images of magazines in text and metadata, specific saying when the user will put here the images
                        he will receive information about who is the autor, witch one is the title, the ISBN of the article and also raw text, but this regarding the type of the magazine.
                        <br><br>
                        The point from where this project started is from having a a set of training data, saying images and their metadata, after which we 
                        trained a program to recognize the same behaviour in different images.
                        <br> <br>
                        This program should save a lot of time when it comes to search for a specific information to be used.
